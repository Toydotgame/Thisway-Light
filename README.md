### Thisway Light is Discontinued
The last version of the plugin has been released, and this page will stay up as an archive as such. Thanks for your interest in the plugin.
Thisway Light is a stripped down version of Thisway, and normal Thisway is already very basic - so might I reccomend that you use that instead for longer support?

# Thisway _Light_
A speed-oriented fork of Thisway based on speed, reliability, and smaller filesizes.

## Usage
Roughly the same as the original:
```
/tw <distance>
```

## Version
Versions of Thisway Light come out a little bit after Thisway, due to me having to code the features twice. See the [Releases](https://github.com/Toydotgame/Thisway-Light/releases) tab, as it'll have both versions come out in paralell.

## Features
* Same as normal Thisway, except no Debug Mode.
* Extra speed.
* Small file size.
