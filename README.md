# Thisway _Light_
A speed-oriented fork of Thisway based on speed, reliability, and smaller filesizes.

## Usage
Roughly the same as the original:
```
/tw <distance>
```

## Version
Versions of Thisway Light come out a little bit after Thisway, due to me having to code the features twice. See the [Releases](https://github.com/Toydotgame/Thisway/releases) tab, as it'll have both versions come out in paralell.

## Features
* Same as normal Thisway, except no Debug Mode.
* Extra speed.
* Small file size.
